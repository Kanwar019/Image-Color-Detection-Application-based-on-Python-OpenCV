The color detection application was implemented using Python, OpenCV, and Pandas. The tool allows users to simply hover the mouse pointer over any pixel in the image to instantly display the closest matching color name, its hexadecimal code, and the corresponding RGB values. The color information is shown in a colored rectangle overlay at the top of the window, updating in real time as the mouse moves. This provides a smooth and interactive experience for identifying colors in any region of the image, as demonstrated in the accompanying video and screenshots.
